# ZooEIMS
This prototype serves as a mock-up of the back-end of an enterprise information management system. In it are multiple databases and classes that control user interactions with these databases, along with other major sections of the Zoo. The project follows OOP principles and is a great jumping off point for developing a deeper system with more functionality.
